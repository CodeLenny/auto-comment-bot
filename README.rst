Automatically post comments when issues and pull requests are opened.

Features
========

- Support for multiple templates per-repository
- Conditionally comment depending on GitHub variables such as title, body, author, time of post, etc.

Hosted Application
==================

A copy of the application is hosted for your convinence.

Go to https://github.com/apps/auto-comment-bot to install it for your repository.

The application is currently hosted on https://glitch.com/ to reduce costs,
but this means that the uptime is out of my hands, and use of the hosted server is at your own risk.

See https://glitch.com/~auto-comment-bot for the source application.
